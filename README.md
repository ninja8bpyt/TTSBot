# TextToSpeech ðŸ”Š
This bot allows you to turn any text into an audio directly on Telegram.<br>
It works in private chats, in groups, and even inline!

It is available on Telegram at https://t.me/TTSBot


### Does the bot save my audios?
The bot only stores audio files temporarily and deletes them immediately after they've been sent to Telegram.<br>
The bot never saves any of your audios or their text in its database, and never will.<br>
The only information that is stored in the DB is for statistics purposes only.<br>

### Self Hosting

- Basic understanding of docker and docker-compose
- Basic understanding of python
- Basic understanding of postgresql
